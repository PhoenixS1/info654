        Goonatilake describes the neural element in the following way:
To adapt to the changing everyday environment feedback loops exist between the neural system and the environment, influencing the behaviour of both (p. 119).
In the phenotype which is created out of genotypal information, there are other information-producing ‘devices’ in the form of hormonal and neural circuits â€¦ These extra-genetic devices provide also the means by which cultural information is transmitted from generation to generation (p. 15).
He is careful to distinguish between neural systems, which "can exist without transmissions of acquired information from parent to offspring" (p. 119), and cultural systems in which "such transmissions across generations, however, do occurâ€¦" (p. 119). He treats the combined "neural-cultural" as the second flow line. Thus information can be transferred between the animal and the environment, and from one animal to another through observation or communication in real time. He traces the history of encephalization, or growth of brain size relative to body size in mammals, and points out that some ecological niches demand more and some less brain development (p. 19).
