            Goonatilake (1991) has identified and defined what he calls information flow lineages through the history of living matter on the planet. He argues that there have been, and continue to be, three lines of information transmission in association with life, which he calls the genetic, the neural-cultural, and the exosomatic "flow lines" of information transmission (Goonatilake, 1991, summary on pp. 118-120). Genetic information is transmitted through the usual processes of biological inheritance, influenced by natural selection. He states:
Beginning from prebiotic origins a continuous lineage of information and of organized complexity exists as a genetic flow system. As evolution proceeds through time, these lines of genetic information spread out and radiate into new environmental niches (p. 118).
Further:
Metaphorically one could say that the flow line has a ‘conversation’ with the environment, successful conversations becoming congealed in the genome (p. 125).
Thus, the characteristics of organisms that promote their fitness, that is, that enable organisms to survive and reproduce in a given environment, are propagated through time in their genetic makeup.
